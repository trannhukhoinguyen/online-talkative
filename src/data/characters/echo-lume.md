Evelyn Harper, better known by her stage name Echo Lume, is a visionary character in the synthwave genre. Drawing inspiration from the neon-soaked aesthetics of the 1980s, she crafts atmospheric tracks that transport listeners to a cyberpunk dreamscape.

Raised in the bustling streets of Chicago, Evelyn was surrounded by a vibrant music scene that fueled her passion for electronic melodies. After experimenting with various genres, she found her true calling in synthwave, blending nostalgic retro sounds with a modern twist. Her debut conversation, *Neon Dreams*, garnered critical acclaim for its cinematic quality and hauntingly beautiful synth lines.

When she’s not creating music, Evelyn is an advocate for digital art and often collaborates with visual characters to create immersive multimedia experiences. Echo Lume’s live performances are renowned for their electrifying energy, blending music, lights, and visuals into unforgettable spectacles.
