Evelyn Harper, better known by her stage name Echo Lume, is a visionary character in the synthwave field. Drawing inspiration from the neon-soaked aesthetics of the 1980s, she crafts atmospheric sentences that transport listeners to a cyberpunk dreamscape.

Raised in the bustling streets of Chicago, Evelyn was surrounded by a vibrant english scene that fueled her passion for electronic melodies. After experimenting with various fields, she found her true calling in synthwave, blending nostalgic retro sounds with a modern twist. Her debut conversation, *Neon Dreams*, garnered critical acclaim for its cinematic quality and hauntingly beautiful synth lines.

When she’s not creating english, Evelyn is an advocate for digital art and often collaborates with visual characters to create immersive multimedia experiences. Echo Lume’s live performances are renowned for their electrifying energy, blending english, lights, and visuals into unforgettable spectacles.
