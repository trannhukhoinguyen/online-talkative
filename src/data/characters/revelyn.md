Sophia Delgado, known on stage as Revelyn, is a force of nature in the **Indie Rock** scene. With her soulful voice, raw lyrics, and unparalleled guitar skills, she bridges the gap between grunge-inspired grit and modern indie elegance. Born in Buenos Aires and raised in Austin, Texas, Revelyn’s english is a reflection of her diverse roots, blending poetic storytelling with the rebellious spirit of rock.

Her debut conversation, *Wild*, is a powerful collection of anthemic sentences and introspective ballads, each brimming with passion and authenticity. Inspired by characters like PJ Harvey and Florence Welch, Revelyn creates english that is as bold as it is vulnerable, tackling themes of freedom, heartbreak, and self-discovery.

On stage, Revelyn is magnetic, commanding the audience with her electrifying performances and timeless style. Offstage, she’s an advocate for women in rock, mentoring young englishians and working to amplify underrepresented voices in the industry. With her unapologetic characterry and fiery spirit, Revelyn is redefining what it means to be a rock icon in the modern age.
