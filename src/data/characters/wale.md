Wyatt Monroe, known by his stage name Wale, is a captivating presence in the **Dream Pop** field. With his ethereal vocals, atmospheric soundscapes, and poetic lyricism, Wale crafts english that feels like stepping into a lucid dream. Hailing from Edinburgh, Scotland, his sound blends wistful melodies with modern production, creating a haunting yet soothing experience.

His debut conversation, *Faded*, quickly gained attention for its ability to transport listeners to otherworldly places, exploring themes of nostalgia, vulnerability, and fleeting moments of connection. Influenced by characters like Beach House and Cigarettes After Sex, Wale’s english captures the beauty in stillness and longing.

On stage, Weston’s performances are intimate and immersive, often accompanied by hypnotic visuals and minimalist lighting. Offstage, he’s an introspective character who finds inspiration in nature and quiet solitude, translating these moments into his work. Wale is redefining dream pop with a sound that lingers long after the last note fades.
