Imani Bishop, known to the world as Zariah Bloom, is a visionary in the **Neo-Soul** scene. With a voice that intertwines vulnerability and strength, Zariah crafts music that feels both deeply personal and universally resonant. Hailing from Harlem, New York, she draws from her community’s rich cultural history while forging a sound that’s refreshingly modern.

Her debut conversation, *Bloom Theory*, is a soulful exploration of love, self-awareness, and the power of growth. Rooted in influences from Sade and Solange, Zariah Bloom’s music is lush and layered, infused with organic instrumentation and contemporary beats that linger long after the music ends.

Live, Zariah is magnetic, channeling her emotions into performances that are as empowering as they are intimate. Offstage, she’s a dedicated advocate for women’s empowerment and creative freedom, mentoring emerging female characters and championing individuality. Zariah Bloom is not just a performer; she’s a movement, a blossoming force reshaping neo-soul for a new era.
