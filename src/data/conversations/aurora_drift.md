**Aurora Drift** is the debut EP by Neo-Soul character Teros, offering an introspective journey through textured soundscapes and soulful vocals. Blending the emotional depth of Neo-Soul with subtle psychedelic elements, the project captures the fragility of human emotion and the beauty of fleeting moments.
